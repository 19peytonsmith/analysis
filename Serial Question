My serial question is, "Where were the Russian and Japanese fleets during the year of 1905?" I am asking this question because the Russo-Japanese war occured during this time and the two military powers engaged in quite a bit of naval combat. We know the Japanese won the war and we are aware of the major battles that occured at sea. The information in the Egyptian Gazette can provide a wealth of ship names, smaller skirmishes, admirals and fleet movements that would otherwise go unmentioned in most historical collections. 

I am querying the text for terms such as: "navy", "Rodjestvensky", "Togo", "fleet" and "battle". After searching with each key word, I find each piece of naval information that relates to my question and record the date, location and details of what occured. Then, using Google Maps, I plot points at the various locations of naval action and tag them with a description of the available information. The points are numbered in order of date to provide logical progression of fleet movements. 

I also created three different layers for my points. The first layer is for movements of the Russian fleet, which is colored blue. The second layer is for instances involving the Japanese fleet and these points are colored red. The third and final layer is colored purple and reserved for points of engagement between the Russians of the Japanese. The three layers can be added and removed as the viewer pleases, allowing for the rather complicated map to be cleaned up. 

As the project has been coming together I have noticed that the Russians seem to have their fleet much more spread out than the Japanese do, likely making their battle groups smaller and susceptible to larger Japanese forces. The Russians appear to have had the majority of their fleet stationed in the North Sea, the Baltic and the Mediterranean. From there, they moved to confront the Japanese threat by traveling East primarily through the Suez Canal. There were frequent reports of small groupings of Russian warships that were detached from main forces moving from harbor to harbor with no apparent motivation. Meanwhile the Japanese were already well established and concentrated in the far East and had most of their military vessels consistently in large battlegroups. 

Naturally, most of the action occured near China, Japan and the Eastern coast of Russian. Significant battles were fought in this region, such as the Russian defeat at Port Arthur and then again in the Korean Straits, an event which left Admiral Rodjestvensky devestated. It is not surprising that the Russians were defeated so horribly by the Japanese. One of the most interesting events turned up by my research was an event when a portion of the Baltic Fleet fired upon the royal yacht of King George I of Greece while he was traveling from Denmark to France. This mishap is excellent evidence of the inexperience of the Russian navy, which was likely a major factor in the Russian defeat.
