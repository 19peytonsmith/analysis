title: Fluctuation in Egyptian Cotton Exports Throughout the Year
author: DanteGrieco

For millennia, cotton has been cultivated extensively in Egypt along the banks of
the Nile Valley.

My serial question involves looking at a snapshot in the historical trends of the
cotton trade in colonial Egypt. During Egyptâ€™s years under British colonial rule,
cotton became an incredibly significant and profitable cash crop. Following the
decline in American cotton production because of the American Civil War, England
turned to Egyptian cotton as a source of profitable trade within its empire. To
gain a sense how the cotton trade behaved during this period, my analysis uses
data sourced from cotton export reports from various issues of the English/French
language financial newspaper The Egyptian Gazette over the course of the year 1905.
Specifically, the data looks at the amount of cotton exported to certain countries
on a monthly basis.
