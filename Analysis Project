## Temperature in the Daily Weather Report
The data I used for this project was gathered from two separate tables within the Daily Weather Report. The Alexandria
temperatures were retrieved from the bottom of the first table in this section, appropriately titled "Alexandria". Acquiring
this section of the data required two X-Path queries as follows- //table[@xml:id="deg-ta-dawr01"]//cell[contains(.,"Min. Temp in the shade")]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number() and
//table[@xml:id="deg-ta-dawr01"]//cell[contains(.,"Max. Temp in the shade")]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number(). These gave me both sets of temperatures for Alexandra, the maximum
and minimum.

All other data was gathered from the "Other Stations" table, as each location reporting data corresponds to a weather station
in Egypt. For these stations I used a similar query to the one used for Alexandria, just with a different xml:id. These were all
some variation of //table[@xml:id="deg-ta-dawr02"]//cell[contains(.,"Port Said")]/following-sibling::cell[1]/number(). I manipulated
this query, changing the [contains(.,"-")] to different station names, also using both cell[1] and cell[2] to obtain the maximum
temperature values as well as the minimum.

#### Why temperature?

Analyzing and observing the variations in temperature reported in the Egyptian Gazette may be relatively boring on it's own, but the
applications of such a query is boundless. Although somewhat mundane on its own, the weather in cities affects a huge number of variables
from tourism to cotton prices. My own analysis project only focuses on temperature because the area alone has not been explored in depth
before. I wanted to fill a hole of information as well as to provide some preliminary analysis/data compilation for future analysts of the
Egyptian Gazette that may be interested in the effects of temperature on some other phenomenon, but don't necessarily want to spend the time
compiling and organizing such a large amount of raw data.

#### The Data

All data is what was updated as of noon on April 12th for the purposes of being able to clean up data and create visualizations before continuing
the project. For each location, for both the maximum and minimum temperature, I removed the data that was the same as the template data. The incomplete
data (i.e. data that was copy and pasted from the template but not updated with the data from the contributor's week) was more common in the
"Other Stations" chart than in the Alexandria temperatures. A few days also appear to not contain an "Other Stations" table at all, so Alexandria
Station has a good deal more data than the other locations, making the averages more accurate than any other station included.

These are the monthly average temperatures in some of the stations reported in the Daily Weather Report
during 1905 and 1906. I chose the seven that are included because they were contained in the most editions of
the Egyptian Gazette and actually contained data the most often. There were a few excluded from my data analysis
because they were either only included in a smaller portion of the newspapers or contained too much null data to be
at all useful.

As you can see in the graph, there are a few months which contain no data for one or many locations. The limitations
of the data are such that the month of October in 1905 only has one day of the newspaper containing a daily weather report
with the proper xml:id, and so only returned one piece of data for every location. The average for that month, therefore, is
only one number. This single day had no recorded data for the Cairo Halouan station, and so one missing number results in an entire
month missing from our visualization. The entire month of January in 1906 is also missing for every station except for Alexandria;
this month also was an average of only one day, and that day of the newspaper did not contain the "Other Stations" chart at all.

_AvgMinTemp here_

The same gap in data for the maximum temperatures in January 1906 exists for the minimum, breaking up the data for all stations
other than Alexandria. Both Port Said and Suakin stations have similar gaps in data for August 1906 because of data limitations-
there are only two days of data for October.


#### Conclusions

As the text of the Egyptian Gazette is updated and edited, the data for this analysis will grow in size and will (hopefully) become
increasingly accurate.
