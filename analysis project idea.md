For my analysis project I am going to analyze the average annual temperatures of the cities Assouan (Aswan) and Port Said in the “Daily Weather Report”.
 I will compare the two average temperatures and analyze seasonal changes in temperatures to see if there are any relations or vast differences between the two locations.
 With the information on the lows and highs of both locations I can see if there were any extremely hot or cold days where people could have been affected. An example of
  this would be the possibility of getting sick with a disease, or work getting cancelled for the day. For my visual representation of the data that I collect
   I can map out the locations of the cities Port Said and Assouan and average out the annual temperatures to see if there were any “hotspots” within Egypt.
