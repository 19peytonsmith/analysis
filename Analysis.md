While looking through the Egyptian Gazette I found a plethora of interesting articles on varying subjects, but the most interesting articles to me where about the Russian Revolution that took place from January 1905 – July 1907. I had very little knowledge on this topic beforehand, not knowing that it even existed. Even though I had no knowledge of it and thought it was unimportant it seemed like a major concern the readers of the Egyptian Gazette. With this in mind I wanted to explore the question: What role did the Russian Revolution play within the lives on the readers of the Egyptian Gazette?

To understand and conduct this research question I have to know about the Russian Revolution. The Russian Revolution started in January of 1905 due to 4 main problems that the Russian government had. The first problem was the social structure which revolved around how land was handled amongst people. A couple of years before the revolution serfdom was ended and new laws were implemented in order for peasants to be able to own land. The peasants would pay small payments over a large time, but the peasants would work as a community owning the land in order to pay. The problem with this that the land was not enough for them to support themselves. Along with this problem they also had to pay taxes to government for owning land which made it incredibly difficult to live.

Another problem that contributed to the Russian Revolution was that the Russian economy was in a slump. The Russian government was spending too much on was supplies, the economy was importing foreign goods while not producing any agriculture to ship out and the price of grain dropped. These factors led to the along with the taxes and community payments led to anger amongst the peasants.
The educated class was also dissatisfied with the government. Before the revolution Tsar Alexander II abolished serfdom and lifted restrictions on university. This allowed many to go into universities and express their ideas in forms that they could not achieve before due to the lack of knowledge. Due to these reforms the educate class became out spoken and started talking against the government, which led to the government putting restrictions on education. This led to anger amongst the educated class.

The war was between Russian Government and nobility against working class, peasants, and the lower educated class. In the end the Russian government won, but many new laws and a new constitution were set in place to appease the revolutionist.

In order to answer the question on what role did the Russian Revolution play within the lives on the readers of the Egyptian Gazette, I used an X-path query. It took many tries to get to the right results and even then there were still problems. The main and most significant X-path query that was used is //div[@type=“item”][contains(., “Russia”) and contains(., “revolution”)]. This produced an item that contained the word “Russia” and any word that contained “revolution” such as revolutionary. I noticed that this only produced one item per item, but when reading them I notice that many times there were several more articles on the Russian revolution, but didn’t use both “Russia” and” “revolution” because they already used it earlier. To solve this problem, I read each section that my query gave results for. This helped me and in two ways, one it gave me a better understanding on how the newspaper reported the Russian revolution and it also helped me create better quarries to help me look up certain questions I had.

When I went through my query the first time I took notes on certain people, places, and things I thought were valuable. I also recorded the dates that month and year that the words “Russia” and “revolution” appeared on to understand if the Russian revolution was more discussed upon at certain dates. This led me to create this bar graph:

This graph shows many things, one of which is that the Russian revolution started to be more discussed as the year went by. This makes sense logically as usually a war starts off with a big event that gets a lot of coverage and then dies down and picks up again. There are still some notable problems with the graph such as the low values in January and February, which is when the civil war started. It would reasonable that to assume that there would be coverage on this event if a war did start. There can be a few reasons why we see this trend, the first could be that the Egyptian Gazette editor did not believe that this would turn into a war, another issue could be that there is a lack of data early in year which led to the graph being misrepresented. The final possibility is that there were other, more important events happening at the turn of the year. Two possible conclusion can be drawn, the first is that there is just a lack of data. The second, more revealing conclusion that helps understand how the Russian revolution affected readers of the Egyptian Gazette is that the readers were uninterested in the Russian revolution. They may have just seen this as another story or something that would blow over quickly and not affect them. It seems clear based on the results that readers of Egyptian Gazette weren’t interested in the Russian Revolution.

Another interesting trend seen in the graph is the almost steady increase of mentions of the Russian revolution in the Egyptian Gazette.
