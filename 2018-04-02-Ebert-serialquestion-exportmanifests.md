# H1 Serial Question: How do Egyptian exports vary in 1906?
At first I wanted to do the "royal celebrations" topic from the syllabus but I could not find any helpful results from the query.
By looking at my page images I saw that there were multiple mentions of King's and prince's birthdays and anniversaries but when I tried
to find them using an xpath query it only gave me random results. Instead I decided to compare the Export Manifest sections like we
did in class, if that is allowed. When I did this query: //div/head[contains (., "Export Manifests")] it returned 177 results. Even after
looking at the instructions for querying and blogging I am still having a lot of trouble, so I am planning on coming to office hours
Friday.
