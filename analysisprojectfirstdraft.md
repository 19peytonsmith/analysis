Analysis Project First Draft
I will explore the Egyptian education system in the early 1900s. This project will include the locations of new schools that are being built and old schools that are torn down. This will also include what months of the year education seems to be of most importance in the newspaper. I will also look for trends in the school system, such as common problems (Sailer, 1912) or modernization (Saleh, 2012) . This project will most resemble a timeline and I will be looking for a pattern in the paper for when schools are mentioned and why they are being mentioned.
