After looking through my issues, I the cotton market is often affected by the
weather of week. The cotton market produced good business, according to the values.
I hope to provide a research the agricultural that profit Alexandria and provide
a visualization of the values of the cotton market from 1905-1906.
I began an Xquery search to look for the cotton market values and looked up
matches for the name cotton market which didn't produce a few results, but
now I have to narrow my search to look up the values necessary.
