	The city of Alexandria is a port city located in Egypt. The weather is typically hot and humid. For over one hundred years, the city of Alexandria has collected data on the warm climate. An Egyptian newspaper, the Egyptian Gazette, had listed the temperature in Celsius as well as the relative humidity every week for as long as the paper continued to be published. As science and technology has increasingly advanced, cars, livestock, and air pollutants have been theorized to gradually increase the average temperature of Earth. I will observe and analyze the comparative details between the listed temperatures in the Egyptian Gazette over the years 1905-1906, and a time one hundred years later specifically 2005-2006. This analysis is incredibly specific, and only covers the weather of Alexandria; however, the outcome can serve as one instance that supports the notion that human advancement is causing global warming. I will be taking the listed max temperatures in Celsius for the summer months in Alexandria which is listed as between May and October. The reason for using only summer months is simply the misnomer of global warming suggesting that global warming makes whatever climate is present harsher; for instance, summer months will be hotter, and colder months will be colder.  Adding in winter months will make the data rather convoluted. It is important to note that the Egyptian Gazette’s weather report lists the temperature measured as “max temp in shade.” This just means that the measurement is not tainted by outside elements such as sunlight; the temperature of today is measured the exact same way so there are no discrepancies between the 1905-1906 group and the 2005-2006 group.  
	The amount of cars in Alexandria during the early part of the twentieth century is incomparable to the sheer amount of cars present today in Alexandria. The technology of the automobile in 1905 was only twenty years old at that point. For the most part, cars were reserved for middle to upper class. The very few instances of a car being mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette usually pertains to a rich person. For instance, a lot of the automobile mentions pertain to someone who is of the royal family. In August of 1906, Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, cousin of the Khabib, was killed in a car accident. This instance is one of the few times cars are even mentioned in the Egyptian Gazette. Other than anecdotal evidence from a newspaper, there is no survey that gives an accurate number for car population; however, to put into perspective the United States only had 78,000 cars in 1905. Considering that the United States was one of the original countries to pioneer the automobile, it is reasonable to suggest that the amount of cars in Alexandria never exceeded such an amount in 1906, and was probably nowhere near that amount. All of this evidence is to show the vast difference in the number of cars contributing to global warming between 1905-1906 and 2005-2006. The difference is important to specify as this analysis goes off the basis that fossil fuel emission contributes to the warming of the atmosphere. With this in mind, we can expect any noticeable increase in temperature in Alexander to be indicative of global warming. 
	The Egyptian Gazette had a section in the earlier pages of the newspaper known as “The Daily Weather Report.” Despite the name of the table, the weather report only occurred in the paper once a week. The weather report consisted of the average maximum temperature for that specific week.
