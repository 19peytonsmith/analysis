title: Donkeys in <i>Egyptian Gazette</i>

<b>Brewing the Idea</b>

I began upon this subject for my analysis project through my blog post that I wrote earlier in the class. I found a peculiar article in my week of March 1905 entitled “A Cairo Nuisance”. It was all about “donkey-boys” and how they harass residents of Cairo. Today, one would be hard-pressed to find someone in America who regularly sees donkeys, much less is harassed by their owners, so this subject interested me. The closet thing I could think of was people at the mall who stand at the kiosks and politely verbally accost you until you try their perfume samples. As the article indicates, there are already cabs in Cairo, so are the donkeys a fading form of transportation? Are they pets? What type of person owns them? The “Cairo Complainer” (a name I have given the anonymous Cairo resident who wrote the original article) seems to be of a status that is above donkeys. With so many questions, I was curious about their role in 1905/1906 Egypt, and wanted answers.
This course focuses around micro history, which is using small facts and details found in primary sources and weaving them into a larger, big-picture look at history. In any history class, no professor spends a lecture on donkeys. At the same time, there were clearly donkeys in Egypt at the time; they were a part of the lives of the residents in Egypt. Despite their seemingly unremarkable role, they had a role nonetheless. Therefore, I found this subject to be perfect for a serial micro history investigation.

<b>Serial Question</b>


I realized that although my original article focused on the “donkey-boys”, it would be more fruitful to be slightly less specific and broaden my topic to be on the subject of donkeys in general. My goal is to learn exactly how donkeys were used and perceived by those living in Egypt at the time. It is unrealistic to think that every perspective of donkeys is present in the Egyptian Gazette, especially given the audience is French and English people living in the area at the time.  so I arrived at the serial question “What is the role of donkeys in 1905/1906 Egypt as represented by The Egyptian Gazette?”.

<b>XPATH Query</b>

To practically answer this question, I needed to create an XML search query. This allows me to search all the issues of the newspaper that have been uploaded to our content repository on Github, effectively searching through every daily issue of the Egyptian Gazette from 1905 and 1906 that has been completed. An XML search basically needs two things... a WHERE, and a WHAT.

<i>  What?</i>

My “what” was easy... donkeys. I knew that I need to try to find every reference to donkeys that I could. I realized that there is more than one word for donkey, but after some preliminary searching, I saw that the most common substitute turned up primarily the word “association”. It seemed like donkey was the term of the land for the creature.

<i>Where?</i>

As discussed before, I needed to find every mention of donkeys that I could. I might find these mentions on page 2, 3, 4, anywhere. However, I knew that I wouldn’t find the references in a specific advertisement or table as many of my classmates would. Therefore, I made my search a general search for the word “donkey”.
//p[contains(.,"donkey")]

However, XML searches are case sensitive. I still had one more search to do.
//p[contains(.,”Donkey")]

I collected my results for the first query on Friday April 21st at 4:28 p.m. and the second query at 5:35 p.m. on Friday, April 21st. Then, I organized them by topic and formulated the results section of this paper.

<b>Challenges</b>

Not all of the articles were corrected perfectly from the OCR software, so I had to do some decoding to figure out what they were saying. Keeping this in mind, there could be other mentions of donkeys that I was not able to discover because someone failed to correct a misreading by their OCR software. Occasionally, I would come across a section that was improperly divided, or missing appropriate sections. For example, despite the word “donkey” being mentioned only once, I received a several different articles as results and had to sift through them to find the content I was searching for.  In addition, on May 11th, 1906 and May 9th, 1906, the same articles were featured. I’m not sure if this is intentional, a mistake of the Gazette, or a mistake of a fellow transcriber.

<b>Results</b>

From the XPATH query, I found 41 mentions of the word “donkey”. In addition, I found 21 occurrences of the word with its first letter capitalized. Every article and the date can be found in the appendix of this paper. There are not 41 entries in the appendix because sometime the word appeared more than once in an article that was a continuation of the same topic. As discussed in a previous section, I organized them by subject. There were a handful of articles that did not fit into any of the categories, such as the one-off use of the phrase “Donkey Tail Principle”, and in a mention of horse shows. Below is a visualization of the different topics I organized the articles into. The bigger the circle, the more articles were in that category. More detail on the topics follows the visual.

<img src = "topiccircles.jpg">

<i> Donkey Racing - 10 occurrences</i>

Donkey Racing mentions occurred at any time of the year. There were some in January, February, April, May, June August, and December. Therefore, donkey racing does not seem to be a seasonal sport. Many of the articles included who won which race, what times the races would occur, and information along those same lines. On August 16th, 1906 donkey races are described as “modest”. There was a variations of donkey racing that I found interesting. On June 1st, 1905. This article mentions that one of the sports they performed were Tug-of-War on donkeys!

<i> Donkey Boys- 6 occurrences</i>

Piecing together the persona of donkey boys has been surprising. Their appearance must have been distinct because on March 12th, 1906, Mr. Firth was reported as dressing as one for a costume party. It was also reported that a man named Mohamed Dodo owns 60 donkeys and donkey boys. That means that these people are likely viewed as (at least) second class citizens due to the fact that they can be owned.
Although the original article I found negatively portrayed the donkey boys, I found two separate events that praise donkey boys for their action. On May 24th, 1905, a group of people had stones being thrown at them, but the donkey boys were not among those throwing the stones. Also, in July of 1905, there was a man who was beaten by someone, and the donkey boys were eyewitnesses and testified as to who the abuser was. The praise may stem from them typically being considered nuisances, but I think that with this little information, it is unfair to make that broad assumption.

<i>Animal Cruelty- 4 occurrences</i>

There seems to be a vocalized care for the treatment of animals throughout the paper, which includes care for donkeys. The SPCA (Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) made strides for the protection of donkeys. In March of 1905, they declared that no longer would the same yolks that are meant for Buffalos be allowed on donkeys. That September, 82 donkeys were treated by at the animal hospital. From January 10th-April 24th, 301 donkeys were treated.

<i>Crimes- 3 occurrences</i>

Two occurrences focused on their donkeys being stolen, which means that donkeys were valuable enough for someone to care that they were missing. In August of 1906, a man was arrested for murdering his servant because his servant lost his donkey’s stirrups.

<i>Transportation and trade:-17 occurrences</i>

It was common for reporting to be done on people traveling by donkey. Even the Khedival family traveled by donkey (February 1st, 1905). They were used not only to transport people, but also for trade purposes. The donkeys were traded, and things they transported were traded too, such as wood and other heavy things. They’re mentioned as being a part of street clutter on September 5th 1906. As of September 1st of 1905, it was mentioned that “despite trains”, donkeys were still the preferred method of transportation. However, an article from May 19th, 1906 states that the train was replacing the donkey as a form of transportation.

<i>In Art- 2 occurrences</i>

Donkeys were featured on art, mentioned February,1905. There was a play called “Darktown Donkey Race” put on by people in Alexandria. I believe it to be a musical because there was another article about how a band played a song from the production.

In sum, donkeys seem to be a common, but fading part of the transportation/trade portion of people’s lives in Egypt in 1905/1906, as represented by the Egyptian Gazette. When donkeys weren’t used for trading, they were frequently used for racing. Although donkey boys may not have been held to the highest opinion, the SPCA still cared about the wellbeing of donkeys.

<b>Visualization:</b>

For the visualization of this data, I created a word cloud of all of the appearing in the same articles as the word donkey. I chose to do this because the words that most frequently occur with the word donkey should be an indication of what things were associated with donkeys, giving insight as to how they were perceived in early 20th century Egypt. Here is a word cloud of all of the words occurring in the same paragraphs. The bigger the word, the more often it occurred.

<img src = "wordcloud.jpg">

Although this looks nice, I have also developed a black and white version of the cloud. I did this because some colors stand out more. For example, it's easier to read the lighter ones than the darker ones. That should remove bias of some words seeming more important than others beacusse of color and not because of size.
<img src = "wordcloudbw.jpg">

The sizes of many of the words make sense! For example, "Race" is large. Racing was a popular topic as shown by the ciruclar visualizaton. "Boy" is another popular word, and my explanation is the same that of "Racing" being represented so boldly. Many of the months are featured in large print on the graphic. This is because I included all the dates of the articles in the document that I uploaded to create the word cloud. It does appear that the highest number of the articles occured in May, which is reflected in visualization. I'd like to note that Cairo was much larger than Alexandria. This may be attributed to their geographical location, given that Cairo was an inland city (unlike Alexandria), and more transportation/traveling would need to be done on land than by sea. Some interesting things that I found based on the visualizations were the size of the words O'Brien, Miss (especially compared to the size of Mrs. and Ms)

<i>O'Brien</i> - Private O'Brien was the last name of the man who was attacked, that the donkeyboys testified for him in courts. There was a follow up of the trial. They simply used his name a lot when telling the whole story, so that is why his name appears to large in the infographic.
<i>Miss</i> - There were two misses involved in a donkey race, and a long list of misses who attended a costume party. The party was the same one at which Mr. Firth dressed up as a donkey boy. It was strange, because there seemed to be many "Mr."s but that didn't seem highlighted as largely in the word cloud.
<i>Following</i> - The newspaper used the word "following" to precede any sort of list. It wasn't that people with donkeys were following others, or there was a large fan club following donkeys, just a different, unrelated use of the word.
<i>Accused</i> - accused was also used a lot because of the incident with O'Brien. Beyond that story, it was used very infrequently.

Quite a large number of visitors and residents had gathered at Mena
                            House for the Gymkhana yesterday, and though the weather was neither
                            very warm nor very sunny, it was infinitely better than at the last
                            Gymkhana, which was spoiled by the wet. The arrangements made were as
                            good as ever and the prizes greatly admired. Two races, the 7th and the
                            9th, were not run through lack of entries, but in all the rest there
                            were plenty, especially in the 5th(Umbrella and Cigarette Race on
                            Donkeys) where many unsuccessful aspirants for lady partners had to be
                            literally driven from the course. The following are the results of the
                            various events:-

  Donkey Race for Gentlemen. — A fairly good race ended in a victory for
                            Mr. Cotton Fox. Osman Bey Rodwan was second.

On Saturday at 10 pm, the steamer "Ibis" bearing the Royal duca party up
                        river, passed by Edfou. Arrival had been previously made to illumnate the
                        river bank on the occassion of their arrival. The steamer on slackened speed
                        nd the crowds that lined the bank gave a warm salute, to whcih those on the
                        steamer graciously responded. The same day the Princess, accompanied by her
                        husband and three others (apparently belonging to the Khedivial
                        family),arrived here from Assousan. All the party wore European dress, and
                        they were taken at first for Europeans. They had a donkey drive from the
                        bank to the temple, which they visited after sundown. They then returned to
                        their dahabieh, accompanied by the Maniour and the Omideh, who were invited
                        to partake of coffee. Early in the morning they set off for Cairo.

<i>February 4th, 1905</i>

Yesterday afternoon’s pleasant fixture, the Mena House Gymkhana, was
                            attended by a large and fashionable gathering. A number of visitors came
                            out early to Mena to lunch at the hotel before the races began at 3
                            o'clock, and the hospitality of Men's House was taxed to its utmost to
                            provide lunch for the members who flocked out in the morning. The
                            following is a list of prize-winners:— „ Donkey Ram for Gentlemen. — 1.
                            Mr. Wright Anderson, 2. Mr. Paton, 3. Capt Curey.

MAITRE-ALBRECHT'S ACCIDENT.
                    We are glad to hear that Maltre Albrecht is still making favorable progress
                        towards reco¬ very. We have received the following version of the accident
                        that befell him from reliable source. Maltre Albrecht was returning from
                        Tantah in the company of Mr. Lee and Mr. Xenos at the time of the accident
                        The light in the carriage being bad, his two companions were sitting at each
                        corner at the opposite end of the carriage trying to read. Maltre Albrecht,
                        who had a newspaper, stood up by the door of the carriage to get the light
                        behind him. Putting back his hands to steady himself, he caught hold of the
                        door, which had not been fastened, and fell on to the railway. His two
                        companions immediately sought for the com- munication cord, and found that
                        there was none. They then attempted to get to the next carriage, along the
                        footboard, but the speed of the train and the absence of any hand rails made
                        it impossible. At Mansourah they got out and demanded donkeys, which were
                        not to be had, and wired to the station master of the station which they had
                        left, i.e., Samanoud. They were not a little relieved to get an answering
                        wire that Maitre Albrecht had walked into the station with his head cut, but
                        with no further injury. As a matter of fact Maltre Albrecht had been picked
                        up un- conscious on the permanent way. When his friends came to meet him,
                        they found no traces of him, and after waiting for some time were informed
                        that he had been sent to hos¬ pital in the train. Assuming that bo had been
                        sent up to Cairo, they followed there, only to find that he had been sent to
                        Tantah hospital. The unfortunate gentleman received first aid at Samanoud
                        from a Greek doctor. Madame Albrecht immediately hurried down to Tantah and
                        found her husband lying in the hospital with his head bandaged. Apparently
                        nothing else had been done by the doctor responsible for the case, and Mme
                        Albrecht promptly brought her husband back to Cairo.



<i>March 7th, 1905</i>

A Cairo correspondent writes — Cannot something be said or done to abate
                        the great­est nuisance and offence of Cairo, the donkey- boys to wit 1 The
                        shoeblacks, match-sellers, and others are improving daily ; we are no louger
                        pestered except by isolated specimens; and those have the excuse of extreme
                        youth and its consequent impishness. But your donkey boy‘is a real plague.
                        He is usually an "adult," of a very low class, and up Jo the eyes steeped in
                        vice ; that we all know, we need not enlarge thereon. Happily one does not
                        need to pause and hear what “induce­ments” he has to offer for one’s
                        patronage  but he should surely be absolutely forbidden (as is now largely
                        the case at Meoa House) to accost or speak to people l for in this he is our
                        "béte noire." It is impossible to walk quietly past a group of donkey-boys
                        without “Coming, sarr, nioe donkey, sarr,” and much more howled at one, or
                        to stop a moment without excitibga general charge. No reproof has any effebt
                        un­less it be to bring a flow of filthy language. I speak for the residents
                        more than tor visitors. We may not hit.them (they knowthatl) and we most of
                        us cannot waste our time by calling the attention of the nearest policeman.
                        They (the boys) know perfectly well who is resident and who is not, aud I am
                        certain they take a pleasure iu annoying us. Besides, the tone of voice—as
                        if they had been our trusted guides since infancy in every kind of vioe—is
                        an insult How often has it not infariated me when walking peacefully along
                        the streets 1 As if I wanted to ride a donkey, or as if I hadn’t a tongue in
                        my head, or a pair of eyes, to speak and choose for myself as I would a cab.
                        I appeal to the authorities  it would be so easy to give a general order
                        that none ol these people are to acoost passers ; they are all numbered, all
                        have their regular stands aud ranks. Almost always a "shawish” is somewhere
                        within reach ; and if one or two examples were made, we should soon find the
                        Cairo streets peaceful.

<i>March 11th, 1905</i>

At the annual meeting of the general committee of the Cairo S.P.C.A., held in March. 1904, it was decided that an official request in the name of the committee should be addressed to the Ministry of the Interior, to the ---- that instructions should be issued to the mon- dire, forbidding the fellaheen to use, when ploughing vive horses or donkeys, yokes of the kind employed for buffaloes.

The greater the attempt to push Zagazig ahead, the more it falls back, and
                        becomes remarkable for an increase of filth and darkness. The few petroleum
                        lamps we have remain unlit when the moon shines, although she may not rise
                        till 11 o'clock at night! This being the case, in Rue Tewfik, a street
                        nearly a mile long, there are frequent collisions in the darkuess between
                        foot passengers and carts, carriages, and donkeys coming from the interior,
                        in Rue Tewfik are two of the principal banks and two churches; many
                        well-to-do people reside in it, and yet it has been frequently pitch dark
                        there of late.

The "demi-monde" no longer exists in exactly the same manner in which it
                        existed in the past; the "grande cocotte” has hardly the time to realise
                        that she is one, when the hour of her dethronement arrives. Unless the old
                        men are greater liars, and the young ones greater sceptic than one can
                        possibly believe, then the unfortunate creatures who where once creatures of
                        pleasure, and their homes a centre of pleasure, no longer exist And those
                        whose beautiful toilettes wore a “travail de luxe” which gave work to
                        hundreds, and pleasure, not only to the wearer, but to her friends as well
                        might as well not exist so much has the difficulty in attaining celebrity,
                        and the difficulty also of keeping away the “huissiers," and other
                        unpleasant people who are lying in wait increased of late. It seems curious
                        that with all this sudden flow of money all the year round, and all the
                        travelling that is done, there should not be more stirring in the “half
                        world,' but perhaps the world has suddenly become virtuous, pushed this
                        way—on the donkey’s tail principle—by the idea of a separation between
                        Church and State. Anent this question, we are well on the war path

Annoyances of Tourists.—A party of twenty tourists went to Sakkara on Monday.
                        The guardian of the rains refused to recognise their tickets of admission. A
                        heated debate followed, which was adjourned to Marietta's house. No
                        satisfaction followed. On emerging the tourists found a-horde of threatening
                        Arabs waiting. Their donkey and camel drivers remained neutral, and the
                        tourists fled amid a shower of stones. Some were seriously injured. The
                        tourists were much annoyed.

A native contemporary announces that the Cairo Gon-vernorat has received
                            news from Maghaga markaz that the police there have arrested two
                            Englishmen, named Mr. Jones and Mr. Brown. Each of these persons were
                            found in possession of a donkey, which had been stolen from the
                            Bab-el-Louk stand at Cairo.

The Government had prudently inserted a clause in the contract insisting on
                        all the necessary precautions being taken to protect an antiquities that
                        might be discovered during the digging, and the Antiquities Ser- vice posted
                        a ghaffir on the spot who was charge to protect its interests. In August 3
                        the ghaffir was riding over the Tell on a donkey, when the beast suddenly
                        came down heavily. The rider after picking himself up, found that one of the
                        ass’s forelegs had gone through the roof of a vault. He enlarged the opening
                        and saw a treasure; two or three watchers rushed to the spot, the village
                        follow- ed in a body, and the nearest omdeh was sent for.

                        under a white cloth is de- licious past the "best Devon" of London shops.
                        The eggs are brown and new-laid. Sometimes a child comes to the dooe with
                        three or four warm eggs on a platter, asking a few sous.-

If it be a workmen's family, they have brought little, light wood seats with
                        them,and while paterfamilias and materfamilias squat on these the chicks run
                        about on the grass and chase the elusive butterflies Or the father gets out
                        his fishing rod, and there he sits and angles while mother takes the little
                        ones for some milk and cakes. And when the sun goes down and it is time to
                        return home for the evening meal, it is a happy, if tired, company that
                        makes its way onoe more towards the city. The Bois de Bonlogoe crowd on a
                        Sunday is not exclusively composed of poor folks. At this time of year, of
                        course, the wealthy are not numerous in Paris, but last Sunday they were not
                        all at the seaside or in the mountains, and the humble perambulator, and the
                        modest donkey-chaise were frequently passed by elegant broaghams and
                        snorting automobiles. I my friend if be had remarked anything wrong in tbe
                        Continental Sunday. “No," was his reply, “I think we have something to learn
                        from the French."

The increase of the passenger traffic on the state
                            railways is certainly phenomenal when one considers the comparative
                            smallness of the country and the conversative habits of its inhabitants,
                            in many districts locomotion by camel or donkey being still preferred to
                            steam. Yet during the period from the 1st January to the 10th August of
                            this year the augmentation in the number of persons travelling was
                            approximately one and a half millions compared with the same period of
                            1904, the increase in the receipts under this head being L.E. 83,880.
                            The goods traffic also increased enormously, and the increase would have
                            been greater had the administration the requisite rolling stock to cope
                            with it. Notwithstanding this drawback the Government railways carried
                            in the period mentioned 521,432 tons mrore merchandise than last year,
                            with an increase of nearly L.E. 88,000 in the receipts from this branch
                            of the service.</p>

MR WAY AND THE S.P.C.A.
                        Mr. Way, inspector of the Agricultural Bank at Fayoum leaves to day for Ghizeh where he will stay for two months. I should like to take this oppurtunity of testifying to Mr. Way’s business ability and to his popularity in the district Since July last, Mr. Way has been acting as secretary of the S.P.U. A. branch here, daring which time he enlisted no less than sixty new native subscribers of all classes, and has received donations amounting to over £100. Mr. Way has bought a plot of ground on which the S.P.C.A. have erected a hospital for sick animals. Till to-day 115 animals have been treated there, eighty two donkeys, twenty three horses and ten mules, a most excellent start in my opinion.

<i>September 18th, 1905</i>

"Man’s inhumanity to man” is too frequently accompanied by cruelty to
                            animals, and no claims on humanity are greater than those advanced by
                            the societies established for the purpose of repressing that cruelty,
                            and lessening its results on the suffering victim. Com plaints on the
                            parts of visitors daring the winter season have been so frequent of late
                            years that we would urge upon all who can do so, the necessity of
                            exerting any influence, however slight, in the direction of securing
                            better treatment, not only of horses, mules, and donkeys, or other
                            animals which the to cieties more especially protect, but of dogs, oats
                            and birds, the latter more especially, in view of the scenes enacted
                            before the eyes of tourists during their trips on the Nile, for the
                            purpose of extorting money from the sympathetic. Two months will elapse
                            before the tourist influx commences ; it promises to be greater than
                            ever this year, and in proportion to the increase of visitors, will be
                            the number of animals required for their use, and the scope for the
                            practice of cruelty. If in the meantime some efforts can be made,
                            individual and collective, to instruct the native, give him a few
                            lessons on kindness to animals, or, if necessary, set before xxx the
                            probability of punishment for wanton cruelty, a great step will have
                            been taken towards in some measure reducing the shocking cruelty at
                            present so rife, and so little thought of.

  There is flue scope in a country like Egypt for the introduction of the
                            system inaugurated in England many years ago by that eminent
                            philanthropist, Lord Shaftesbury. It is not too much to say that by his
                            efforts in the East End of London, his lordship completely altered the
                            treatment of the London donkey by the costermonger. Instead of treating
                            him as a mere beast of harden, out of which the last ounce should be
                            taken in the way of work, Lord Shaftesbury taught the lesson of kind
                            ness, and by offering prises for the best-kept animals, induced a spirit
                            of emulation among the costers that soon bore fruit in well-fed,
                            well-groomed, and willing animals. The effect of this philanthropic work
                            did not pass away with the man to which it owed its inception, and to
                            this day the results of his life work may be seen by any one acquainted
                            with the London costermonger and his ways. If we were to suggest what we
                            think affords the best opening individual effort for ill-, used animals,
                            we should say that there is much to be done towards inducing better
                            treatment of mules. One has only to watch for a short time the painful
                            straggles of the poor animals in two-wheeled carts, laden with building
                            material, dragging their loads, through deep sands, and straining their
                            utmost to bring them to their destinations, to see how these most tell
                            upon the life of the animals. "The merciful man is merciful to his
                            beast” and it is this lesson that wants enforcing, in and out of season,
                            and at any and every opportunity.

                        ult. The fair, which is primarily of a religious character, is one of the
                        most important, and villagers to the number of several thousands annually
                        flock to it to worship at the little church, where a piece of the true cross
                        and rope are exhibited. The fair is one of conside- rable interest to the
                        ordinary European tourist, as the peasants are for the most part seen in all
                        their finery and a considerable trade in the products peculiar to the Island
                        may be seen in progress. Thither also the dealers in "anticas" find their
                        way, and among the trash which they there try to dispose of may often be
                        discovered by the “knowing’’ ones some pretty and genuine specimens of
                        native silver and other work. The Horse Show is a development of recent
                        years, and is organised under the aus- pices of the Committee for the
                        Improvement of Cyprus Stock. There had been no show for two years, but the
                        entries appeared up to the former average, and it is hoped that every year
                        greater interest will be evinced by native owners of horses and donkeys. An
                        excellent lunch and tea were kindly provided by three ladies, wives of
                        English officials, to which about 60 guests sat down. His Excellency the
                        High Commissioner and Lady King Harman, with their daughter and Mr. Lewis
                        Biddulph, were present, who, when the proceedings termina- ted, started off
                        for a three days’ tour in the district. Colonel Griffiths, Army Veterinary
                        surgeon from Cairo, was among the judges

<i>October 17th, 1905</i>

The next morning I went to see Philae and the Assouan Dam with two others,
                        re- turning across the desert on donkeys. Near the railway station, in fact
                        almost on the platform, was the big 120 ft reflecting ca- mera, and the
                        ground all round bad just been well flooded by the fire-engine so that no
                        dust might get on to ^e reflectors. One mirror reflects the image of the sun
                        120 ft along a canvas tube on to another mirror, which in turn reflects it
                        back along the same tube to a camera placed beside the first mirror. At the
                        time of the eclipse, just before totality, the afternoon train was seen
                        approaching, but as this vibration would have ruined all the exposures, that
                        is for as long as the train was moving, it bad to be stopped at all costs.
                        lo this they were successful by dint of much shouting, and the train came to
                        a standstill outside the station. After lunch I made a complete tour of all
                        the stations of observation, The island had been practically converted into
                        a big observatory. There was one direct telescopic camera 40 ft long, built
                        up in a screen, with a detached screen all round this, to prevent the
                        slightest movement being caused by a possible wind; but perhaps the most,
                        attractive camera of all was that which was called the cross-eyed lady. It
                        consisted pf four photographic telescopes nearly parallel, to photograph the
                        Leavens in the immediate vicinity of the sun. On seeing this strange
                        combination of telescopes one immediately ap- predates the happy appellation
                        of 'crosseyed." The eclipse began at 3.26 p.m. Near me was a reporter for an
                        Arabic newspaper, and as soon as be saw that the eclipse and commenced he
                        tamed round and spent some considerable time in prayer. As the eclipse
                        progressed one felt as if we were looking at everything through blue glass ;
                        this naturally became more and more marked as the sun was increasingly j'
                        obscured. But all the same it was very remark- able what a great amount of
                        light even the smallest part of the exposed son gave Whether this is
                        noticeable in other parts of the world I cannot say; it may be due to the
                        clear- ness of the atmosphere at Assouan. At any rate it made the change
                        from sunlight to darkness very marked. This change same suddenly at the
                        last. A great black shadow swept down over the opposite bill, across the
                        reverend the sun was in total eclipse. Then it was that One could look with
                        the naked eye. It would be wrong to say that the ooron biased forth, because
                        it was only a pale white glow on a background of black, but it somehow
                        conveyed the impression of biasing firth. The rays cf light stream'd forth
                        from every part of the ink blaco disc of the moon, and tho longest streamers
                        appeared to come from the son spot' area and to be about two diameters of
                        the son in length at the left band top corner there was a small prominence
                        (actually 600 miles high, I be- lieve) projecting beyond the moon's diso;
                        this glowed in the moat brilliant fashion, the colour being that of biasing
                        amethyst. Totality began at 4.83 min. 6 seconds, and after two minutes two
                        other glowing promin- ences appeared at the bottom right hand 1 corner ;
                        these grew brighter and brighter until they were lost in the brightness of
                        the sun itself as it shone forth again. During the 2 i min. 24 seconds
                        totality one saw the planet Mars and several stars, also a faint afterglow
                        on the north and south horison, though, of course, the corona was what
                        chiefly held one’s attention. There was a strange stillness broken only by
                        the sound of distant tom-toms and shooting, from Assouan across the Nile.
                        There was practically no wind, and the temperature only fell from 107° at
                        three o’clock to 97° at 5 o’clook.

<i>January 16th, 1906</i>

  We have our usual summer-like winter, the hotels are fairly fall and the
                        beats and trains are constantly adding visitors who desire to make a
                        lengthened stay or tourists who make this the "end of the journey.” The golf
                        club boat sailing, donkey races, and trips to the great Dam give plenty to
                        do.

<i>February 19th, 1906</i>

  Though the procession was advertised to commence at three o’olock, many
                        people were in their seats soon after two, and a steady and ever-increasing
                        stream of all sorts and conditions followed on their steps, till every seat
                        in every stand and loge was filled, and the course was bordered on either
                        side by a gaily-dressed crowd of men, women, and children, which almost put
                        the decorations even 1 out of conceit with themselves. The confetti and
                        flower sellers did a roaring trade, and when their stock was all run out,
                        the enter¬prising Arab gathered up the fragments off the sandy paths,
                        stuffed them again into discarded bags, and reaped a second harvest. From a
                        strictly impartial view it cannot said that the display of decorated
                        carriages could be compared with those to be seen on the Riviera, or indeed
                        anywhere in France during the carnival season, and as a matter of fact there
                        were many who said the display, was not up to the avenge for Cairo, and was
                        inferior even to that of last year. The most, beautiful carriage, and it
                        really was a work of art, was that belonging to Omar Bey Sultan. It
                        represented a huge basket of pure white, with a high arched handle from,
                        which depended long streamers of snowy chiffon. Both handle and basket and
                        its stand were adorned with white flowers, and on it were perched a crowd of
                        white-feathered, doves. The horses, too, were white, and so also was the
                        harness with silver mountings. The coachman, beside whom stood the Bey, was
                        also in white, and the sayces, too, were robed immaculately and carried
                        white and flower- bedecked wands in their hands. It was not surprising that
                        this oarriage obtained the pig d’honneur, a handsome silver cup, and M.
                        Ferdinand de Martino gained the grandprix for his motor decorated with
                        wreaths of violets and white flowers. Another carriage, drawn by two horses,
                        was transformed into a veritable kiosk of flowers wherein was enshrined a
                        dainty lady with two charming children in fairy like attire; another motor
                        oar, which gained the second prize and was owned by M. Alexander Comanos,
                        was transformed into the likeness of a scarlet dahabieh wreathed about with
                        flowers, and two tiny children in a gaily- decorated oar drawn by a
                        diminutive donkey ware overcome with pride when presented with a prize
                        banneret. 0 her prizes ware awarded to the three ladies bearing
                        flower-decked' sunshades (Mmea. Z *her, Beriketti, and Innis), I perhaps the
                        prettiest being one with large transparent medallions encircled with dainty
                        wreaths of lilies of the valley, the fragile hat of the Wwearer being made
                        to coreespond

                        donkey load, chopping 1s. extra; butter 2s. 3d. to 2s. 8d. per lb.;
                        servants’ wages cooks £2 to £3 per month; houseboys 30s. to 50s. per month,
                        exclusive of food which is always supplied to them. House rent ranges from
                        £25 to £60 per annum; scarcely a house can be found outside the town for
                        less than £30 p.a., and for sanitary reasons most English object to living
                        within the city walls. The above prices may not appear' high to those
                        accustomed to European prioes, and with incomes commensurate to a higher
                        rate of living, but they are considerably higher than they were at the time
                        the present rate of official salaries was fixed, and not only so but for
                        purposes of comparison the quality of the goods must be taken into account.
                        Good meat is rarely obtainable, and the botchers have no knowledge of their
                        work. Beef is rot often to be found at all, and is usually so tough (the
                        carcases of worn-out draught animals) as to be barely eatable. At this
                        season lamb is sold as mutton, and the joints, which are minute, oonsist of
                        bone and gristle, all of which is charged for at full rates. The lambs are
                        killed so young that they have no flesh on their bones whatever.

 Helouan has often been accused of being full of invalids, and being far too
                        dull for sound and healthy persons. If that is so, such a statement was
                        entirely disproved on Friday night. The opening dance provided an ex­tremely
                        pretty eight, for the costumes, many of which were extremely clever,
                        presented a kaleidoscope of colours and the scene was watched with interest
                        by numbers of non-dancing visitors from the different hotels and pensions
                        who had been cordially invited. The following are some of the costumes. Miss
                        Zabotkine wore one of the prettiest costaues of the evening, appearing ae a
                        pierette in red, and white, and her sister was a baby in a long lace robe,
                        Miss Warren,early Viotorian; Miss Jones, Mrs. Warren and Miss Totenham,
                        Gipsies; Miss Fawcett, a dainty Geisha ; Miss Darley and Miss Duncan looked
                        charming, the former as a rose, the latter as Duchess of Devonshire; Miss
                        Babington J. Jones as a lady of the last century and her pretty young sister
                        represent­ing Cherry Ripe; Miss Hobson a school-girl of unknown date ; Miss
                        Kirkbright was much noticed as Folly; Mrs. Beckett, Poudre ; Miss Gladys
                        Phillips, dainty Chinese Lady ; Miss Bentley, milkmaid; Miss Philipps, a
                        flower girl. Mr. Mannel and Seligman amused their many friends as Casino
                        girls in somewhat gaudy dresses. Mr. Shelmerdine, chef. Mr. Firth a donkey
                        boy. Dr. Bremner a tennis player fitted with all requirements. Capt. Outran,
                        Order of the Bath. Mr. Charlesworth and his brother a masked gentleman and
                        countryman in a blue smock respectively. Dr. Bentley looked very well as a
                        sheikh, Mr. Bentley jockey; Mr. Sawyer, doctor of music ; Mr. de Cosson,Sir
                        Walter Raleigh, Dr Phillips; 18th Centnry Beau; Mr. Trimers and Mr.
                        Dic­kenson, Anglo- 'mericans; Mr. Nesbit’s costume was particularly striking
                        as a stately Bedouin. Dr. O. Hobson’s costume as Winter was ex­tremely
                        effective Mr. Warren and many others added to the gay scene. In evening
                        dress we noticed Mrs. and Miss Crofton, Capt. Adams, the Messrs. Bennet, Mr.
                        Loftua. Cant. Gordon Cumming, Mr. and Mrs. Firth. Mr. and Mrs. Straker, who

The usually somnolent village of Bedreshein, which is the station for Sakkara (refer to Baedaecker), is in a great state of excitement over the approaching visit of the Royal tra-vellers, who are timed to arrive there at ten o’clock tomorrow, Inshallah! Inter alia the venerable Sheikh of Bedreshein, Mohamed Dodo, has prepared according to his humble estimation a worthy reception, consisting of Bedouin flags and banners draped across the hamlet's most noble thoroughfare. Mohamed is the proud owner of sixty donkeys and donkey-boys, and these have also been decked out for the auspicious occasion.

Apropos of the visit of Sir Edward Clarke to Egypt and the simultaneous attack made upon him by the Protectionists in the City
                    of London because of his attitude respecting tariff reform, the "Westminster Gazette” prints a clever and very amusing cartoon
                    from the pencil of Mr. F. Carruthers Gould. Sir Edward, in full tourist costume, is pictured as seated on the back of a meek-looking donkey,
                    from which position he surveys the 8phinx, the latter bearing the features of Mr. Arthur Balfour, with the addition of the famous
                    monocle of the member for West Birmingham. Sir Edward is represented as making the following comment "Dear me, so that’s the Sphinx.
                    It’s uncommonly like both of them. I suppose it must be the effect of the mirage.”

So far, the Egyptians have shown but little capacity to seize the new opportunities for profitable enterprise offered by these new developments This is more especially to be regretted, owing to the fact that the industries, in which the natives themselves have for centuries found employment, appear to a great extent to be in process of extinction. I alluded to this subject in my last Annual Report (p. 74) I may here add that the tramway is supplanting the Egyptian donkey, and that with the latter is disappearing its saddle-maker and the maker of its trappings. With the disuse of stone floors, the trade of the straw mat maker is tending to become obsolete. Modern pumping apparatus is displacing the rough-hewn waterwheel. The native tanner, lacking technical knowledge and guidance, is being ousted by his more skilled European competitor. The textile industries—with the exception of silk, in which there has recently been some revival—are in a declining state. The products of native looms are being supplanted by the steam-woven fabrics of Europe, and with them the ancillary art of dyeing is decaying. I am informed that even indigo dyeing has practically ceased; the calico, out of which the dress of the fellah is made, being now imported ready dyed by artificial indigo. The flowing robes of delicate shades and embroidered vests, fashioned by the native tailor, are abandoned for the ready-made clothing of continental slop-shops. The manufacture of red slippers has sunk to insignificant proportions. Frequently the red slippers of the Sheikhs —the 'most conservative of all classes — are not slippers at all, but European-made boots, of which the lower portion is an imitation of the native pointed red slipper, and the uppers are cunningly formed of coloured web to imitate socks. The upholsterer, who could cover a divan to meet the needs of the last generation, finds himself unequal to the new demand for Louis XV brocaded chairs and couches. In furniture, clothing, and all necessities, the upper classes are now supplied almost entirely with European goods, and the tendency is working downwards.

The Moudir read the report on the past year’s work of the society, pointing out that in the six months of 1905 during which the society had been in operation the results achieved compared very favourably with a whole year’s work of other provincial branches, despite the fact that it was handicapped by want of funds. A supplementary report also showed that from January 10 to April 24 the society had dealt with 109 donkeys, 9 mules, 6 horses, and 1 camel, or a total from January 10, 1905 to April 24, 1906, of 301 donkeys, 25 mules, 51 horses, and 6 camels.

During last year, 1,572 persons were arrested;
                        35 tons of smuggled salt were seised ;
                        164 donkeys, 10 camels, and 2 hosts were
                        confiscated and sold ; L E 1,100 were paid in
                        fines, and no less then 13,000 days of imprisonment
                        in the aggregate were inflicted on
                        smugglers; and this, although daring the month
                        of December, when the impending change was
                        known to the public, the number of cases of,
                        smuggling showed a large falling off. Practically,
                        all the smugglers belonged to the poorest class
                        the population, and it may be said with
                        some degree of certainty that every animal or
                        host confiscated and sold involved the rain of
                        its owner. It is an unmixed benefit to the
                        country that a system, which produced such
                        results as these, should be wholly abolished.

Remarkable skill is shown by native trackers
                        in bringing guilty parties to justice in the Sudan
                        <unclear/> the night and a case of sugar stolen. The
                        ground in the vicinity is composed of soft sand. The
                        trackers examined the post early the following morning,
                        and soon picked up the tracks of two men and a donkey,
                        which they followed to the Government stables. All the
                        syces were paraded before the trackers, who picked out the
                        Governor's syce and the syce of the Staff Officer as the
                        owners of the tracks. The donkeys were then ministered, and
                        the trackers picked out the Inspector's donkey as the animal
                        whose tracks they had followed. The stables were searched, and some
                        loaves of sugar discovered. Further search was then made and
                        the remainder of the stolen sugar waas dug up clsoe by. The
                        two syces were tried and confessed. They stated that, finding the
                        box was too ehavy to carry, they had used the Inspector's donkey.</i>

Yesterday the Alexandria Parquet authorities went to Ras el-Tin Hospital to
                        hear Private O’Brien’s statements in regard to the attack made against him
                        last week by some natives at Dekhela, near Mex. The soldier’s account of the
                        incident was to the following effect After receiving his week’s pay,
                        amounting to 5 shillings at Mustapha barracks, O’Brien hired a cab at P.T. 4
                        to drive him to a place near the Mex slaughter-house, where cabs usually
                        stop, as the road further on is very bad. There he alighted and walked on
                        till he arrived at Bab el Arab, Mex, where he hired a donkey, giving its
                        owner who accompanied him P.T. 3 in advance, and went on towards the camp.
                        On passing by a native café at the old Mex station, O’Brien heard the words
                        "Johnny’s there” uttered by a native, bat he paid no attention and continued
                        riding on, till he was at a distance of about 200 metres from the cafe.
                        There he was attacked by two natives, who had followed him from that caft,
                        one of whom stopped the donkey and pulled him down to the ground, while the
                        other began to search in his pockets. But being unable to discover the
                        money, which the soldier had hidden is his cap, the two vagabonds fell on
                        O’Brien, and after beating him very severely and kicking him till he became
                        unconscious, made off. The donkey boy was then following his donkey, which
                        had run away. Five minutes later another native who spoke some English
                        passed by the soldier and asked what was the matter with him. The soldier
                        told him what had occurred and requested him to accompany him to the camp,
                        which the native did. O’Brien gave him P.T. 2 without any demand for money
                        being made on their arrival at the camp, whence the injured man was taken
                        later to hospital.

The examination showed that O’Brien had come direct from Mustapha. Tae two
                        culprits were brought before the soldier for identification and he easily
                        identified the man who beat him and knelt on his body, bat was not sure
                        whether the other took part in the outrage or not. The donkey boy, however,
                        identified both.

The trial of the two natives accused of assaulting Private O'Brien, of
                            the Dublin Fusiliers, near Mex on the 21st nlto., began this morning at
                            Alexandria in the Attarin Native Court. The Bench consisted of Judges
                            Ahmed Bey Hilmi, Piesident of the Coart, Yoassef Bey Shawky, and Ahmed
                            Bey Ziour. The Chief of the Parquet was Mohamed Bey Mahfouz. A
                            representative of the Army of Occupation and Miralai Hopkinson Bey,
                            Com¬mandant of the Alexandria City Police, were present. The President
                            commenced the proceedings by asking the accused whether they had taken
                            part in the assault. To this question both replied in the negative. The
                            Chief of the Parquet then read out the indictment and gave a sum mary of
                            the case wherein he showed that there was a strong chain of evidence
                            tending to prove that Mohamed Ismail Kotb and Fayoumi Gabbari, the
                            accused, were guilty of the crime imputed to them. He concluded his
                            speech by asking the Coart to pass an exemplary sentence on the men as
                            there was very clear evidence of their guilt. Private O’Brien then
                            related the circum¬stances of the assault, his statements being
                            interpreted to the Court. The donkey boy who accompanied O’Brien was
                            afterwards called and gave his version of the affair, at the same time
                            identifying the prisoners as the culprits. The advocate for the defence,
                            Aly Bey Assem, then rose and asked Private O’Brien, who was allowed to
                            sit down owing to the state of his health, whether he could account for
                            all the money which he had with him when he started on his journey from
                            Alexan-dris. Private O’Brien stated that he gave P.T. 2 to the cabman P
                            T. 3 to the donkey boy, and P.T. 3 to the native who helped him to the
                            camp after he had been attack¬ed. He started with P.T. 40 and arrived at
                            the camp with P.T. 20, but he was quite unable to state how he had
                            disposed of the rest of the money. Counsel then went on to point out
                            that, although the alleged outrage had been perpetrated on Monday
                            evening it was not until Tuesday evening at 10 o’clock that any
                            intimation of the affray reached the caracol. Yet Private O’Brien was
                            quite able on Monday to give a ver ion of the assault to Private Marvill
                            (No. 3,706). In his statement he declared that the donkey boy, prior to
                            the assault, had addressed some remarks to the two natives who were
                            following him. This clearly showed that the donkey-boy, who might have
                            had a hand in the assault, had recognised some others. In regard to
                            O’Brien, he had declared to Blattner Bey, who translated his story, that
                            he was unable to recognise the men who had attacked him. There were no
                            other confirma¬tory witnesses and consequently the pro¬secution broke
                            down on this question of identification. Why did not the donkey boy
                            return to the nearest house and ask for help ? Probably the boy was
                            particeps criminis and was concealing the truth in order to shield some
                            of his friends, who were the actual perpetrators of the crime, O’Brien
                            knew the donkey boy. When asked in hospital by the Chief of the Parquet
                            to identify the accused, who were present by his bedside, he declared
                            that one of them was the donkey boy, who did not happen to be present.
                            On another day the accused together with the boy were con¬fronted with
                            O’Brien at the hospital and he identified the donkey boy and declared
                            that the other two men were his aggressors. This discrepancy shows that
                            he was incapable of identifying his assailants. Moreover, when the
                            coffee-shop keeper at Mex was asked about the accused, who were said by
                            the donkey boy to have been at his cafe op that evening, he said that he
                            had not seen one of them for three months, as he was keeping away
                            because he owed him money. Kotb is in the service of the salt works and
                            counsel asked the authorities to enquire of this man’s Employers as to
                            his character. Kotb had willingly offered to be confronted with O’Brien
                            together with five other natives as he was so certain that O’Brien would
                            not identify him, but his offer was not enternained by the authorities.
                            Counsel then triod to show that O’Brien, who had received his pay, had
                            lingered in the city until 10 p.m. although he had been told to be back
                            at 9 p.m. This point was overruled by the Court as being not pertinent
                            to the case, and counsel was asked to refrain from this line of defense.
                            The trial was concluded at 12.30 p.m , one of the accused, Kotb, being
                            sentenced to 10 years’ imprisonment with hard labour and his accomplice
                            to 7 years’ imprisonment with hard labour. A full report of the trial
                            will appear in to morrow’s issue.

Murdered for a Pair of Stirrups. A native of Mit Kbaquan, Shibin al Korn
                        mark z, has been arrested on the charge of murdering his servant, owing to
                        the latter having lost the stirrups of his donkey.

Brutal Aggression. The Pyramids road, Cairo, was the scene the other night
                        of a brutal attack on two Europeans, who had gone for a donkey ride. They
                        were attacked next to the "Rendez Vous des Chnsaenm,” that little roadside
                        inn so familiar to tourists and they were found the next morning lying
                        unconscious on the road. Their condition is serious. The aggressors are
                        unknown.

The drainage scheme to which I referred in
                    my last notes is beginning to crystallize into
                    palpable shape. The Monicipality is now
                    buildiog at the end of the Damascus road,
                    which opens into the Square, a few meters of
                    subterranean vaulted sewer of solid masonry,
                    by way of trial, in order to determine the pre-
                    cise cost per meter, and thus be in a position
                    to properly assess the properties on both sides
                    of tbe roads through which the sewers are
                    proposed to be made. I had mentioned that
                    the rate of contribution, according to which
                    the Municipality had called upon the proprie-
                    tors to subscribe, was fixed at 100 piastres per
                    meter; I am now informed by the Mayor,
                    who has the credit of being the initiator of
                    this excellent scheme, that simultaneously
                    with the construction of the sewers the laying
                    of paved sidewalks will be undertaken, and the
                    rate of construction is estimated to amount
                    then to L.T. 2 per meter of built property.
                    This up-to-date system of covered sewerage
                    will incalculably improve the sanitation of the
                    town. The fact of Beyrout being built on a n
                    atural amphitheatre will, by the rather steep
                    inclination of most of the roads, constitute in
                    itself a great source of economy. The sidewalks
                    prove another boon to the inhabitants. The
                    promiscuity of traffic in the streets of Beyrout
                    is as ludicrous as it is revolting. Carriages,
                    cars, trucks, uncouth camels with bulky and
                    obstructive burdens, mules and donkeys with
                    equally cumbersome loads, and riders of horses,
                    mulee, and donkeys, share with the poor pedes-
                    train the limited space of our streets. Indeed
                    the human species has the worst part of the
                    road, and to cap his miseries, lounging, idle,
                    dirty dogs beset his path, and would resent
                    with a growl or a snarl any summary request
                    en the part of the passer-by to make way.
                    But, great as is this nuisance of dogs, it has i
                    ts good side, and I, for one, believe that without
                    these energetic scavengers heaps of fermenting
                    domestic refuse would fill the atmosphere of
                    the town with noxious exhalations. These
                    scavengers perform their duty at least more
                    conscientiously than their paid biped collea-
                    gues of the Municipality.

"Inhabitant” writes from Cairo :—A popular musical programme attracted a
                        large number of people to the the Esbekieh Gardens on Tuesday evening last,
                        when the band of the 1st Battalion Lancashire Fusiliers performed. The works
                        performed included Elgar’s Salut D'Amour, and "Die Zigeuherin” from the
                        Bohemian Girl. One of the most appreciated items consisted of selections
                        from Boito’s Mefistofele, and the Belle of New York was also greatly
                        appreciated. A large number warmly applauded the descriptive fantasia “March
                        Across the Desert,"and the humorous piece "a Darktown Donkey Race” fairly
                        enraptured them. It will be seen that it was one of the beat arranged
                        programmes we have had in the Esbekieh Gardens for some time, as the chief
                        aim of it was to please everybody. In conclusion I should like to say a few
                        words about this band which I have had the pleasure of hearing on many
                        occasions.
