title: Tracking Stray and Ownerless Dogs
author: Hannah Sain
---
In each issue the newspaper that was analyzed from my week, there was often a “Stray and Ownerless Dog” subsection that fell below the Local and General portion of the paper. In the six issues that I started out working with, the stray dog article lists very little information, usually only the location they were collected and when they were to be poisoned by police. This leads to the question “how does the “Stray and Ownerless Dog” section of the paper differ between issues?” More specifically I want to look at the locations the dogs are being found as well as if any other issues (outside of mine) give more detail regarding this practice of poisoning stray dogs, like the reason it is done or an estimation of the amount of dogs taken.
To search through the Digital Egyptian Gazette I will mostly be using querying with specific words such as “ownerless” or “dog” in order to locate the specific articles I am trying to find. In particular, I have been using “//div[@type="item"][contains(.,'Stray')]” which usually brings me to the Local and General section of the files and from there I can locate the information I need.
