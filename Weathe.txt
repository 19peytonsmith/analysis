# Impact from Climate in Alexandria
By: Sami Squires

The climate in Alexandria, Egypt has always been unconditionally hot.
The **Egyptian Gazette** refers the summer months The dry heat gives the
residents no relief, even at night.
Even though Alexandria is close to the Nile River,
 the western desert provides much of that dry heat to Alexandria.
 Many citizens escape the heat by going to somewhere cooler in Europe.
 We may ask ourselves now, was the climate actually suitable for living,
 or was this one of the reasons why the population decreased?
  An day described as an average spring day in Alexandria hit a temperature of
  29 degrees celcius (84* Farenheit).The *Daily Weather Report* from the
  **Egyptian Gazette** highlights the different observed temperatures and
  conditions throughout different locations around Egypt. The graph shows
recorded conditions around Alexandria. The *Daily Weather Report* also records
 the moon phases and other station's conditions. All these values are published
  in the Egyptian Gazette once or twice a week.
  I searched through working sets and got the query-
   //table[@xml:id="AlexandriaWeather"]/row[contains(.,'Max')]/cell[3]/measure
  to get 1905 daily max. temperatures from Alexandria's observations.![Max. temperatures from  1905](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/samisquires/analysis/master/weather%20from%201905.png)
My query helps me define the daily weather conditions, and from there I can
draw a relationship whether population decline could be related to climate
conditions. The seasons in Egypt are quite minimal. It is hot all year around,
but winter and summer align with the U.S., since Alexandria is in the northern
hemisphere.
