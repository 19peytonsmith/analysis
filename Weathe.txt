  An day described as an average spring day in Alexandria hit a temperature of
  29 degrees celcius (84* Farenheit).The *Daily Weather Report* from the
  **Egyptian Gazette** highlights the different observed temperatures and
  conditions throughout different locations around Egypt. The graph shows
