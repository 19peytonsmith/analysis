There is no better way to understand a population than to plainly examine
what it is they do for fun.  The Ancient Romans were obsessed with gladiator
battles, Renaissance Europeans were into the arts and philosophy, and modern
Americans love sports among other things.  But what about Egyptians in the early
20th Century? My serial question is to analyze newspaper reports, specifically
the current events section to understand the entertainment options of Alexandrians
during this time period.
