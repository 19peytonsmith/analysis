The spread of the bubonic plague swept through Egypt during the early 1900s. Regions across the nation that included districts of farms and small town as well as hubs and port cities were all infected by the mass illness. The plague came in different forms that affected a variety of populations in the districts of Egypt. The epidemic did not only hurt the well-being of residents of Egypt, but it resulted in a change in medicine, markets, the economy, and the habits of everyday life for the residents of Egypt.
The plague’s epidemic in Egypt and neighboring nations began in the late 1800s and was a prominent issue until the mid-1900s. The plague came in a variety of forms and infected thousands of humans and animals that resided in Egypt. Breakouts of the plague continued to shift throughout different regions of Egypt at different times which resulted in the uneasy and unpredictable distribution of illnesses and carriers of the plague throughout Egypt. As researchers would soon find out, the plague originated from fleas that infected different goods or people in Egypt. The fleas would bite, live on, and lay eggs on many goods, humans, and animals that would result in their infection. The plague resulted in thousands of deaths and had a serious line of symptoms. Symptoms included skin deformities, nausea, body temperature increasing, and other common illness symptoms. The nature of fleas and their tendencies to move quickly between habitats and reproduce rapidly resulted in the infection spreading across not only Egypt, but Europe as a whole and resulting in what is now known as the Black Death. Residents of Egypt were encouraged by the media and the government of the time to invent ways to trap fleas and prevent the reproduction and growth of fleas that carry the plague. The overall frenzy of the disease resulted in ground-breaking medical advancements that ended the years-long epidemic and saved the lives of many Egyptians and Europeans of the late 19th century.
The bubonic plague epidemic began in the early 1900s with a sweeping illness that resulted in 843 cases of the plague in 1904 and 501 deaths as a result. Throughout Egypt, methods of preventing the plague and its spread began to arise to prevent further fatalities and sicknesses that occurred as a result of the plague. The most prominent reason why the plague was being so quickly and widely spread was because of the strong trading business that occurred in Egypt during the early 1900s. Top locations that showed the highest fatality and contractions of the bubonic plague typically incorporated port cities of Egypt and large hubs. Alexandria, Suez, and Port Said were some of the main cities that had the highest records of the bubonic plague in Egypt. As a result, beginning in 1905, cases of the bubonic plague struck Egypt and its citizens through contractions from other nations. The bubonic plague became a record-breaking epidemic in Egypt. The average rate of contracted illnesses that were a result of the plague was approximately 7 per week and approximately 4 deaths per week from the plague. Nations and regions including India and Upper Egypt have spread the disease through merchants and traded goods between the two locations. As distinguished by Sir H. Pinching and Dr. Cresswell the “infection conveyed …. had been infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt”. Through the use and distribution of these goods the plague impacted many civilians such as one case in January of 1905 that caused the illness of fifteen people and three deaths caused by the bubonic plague. This resulted in a search and cleaning of multiple ships and shipments that may have been affected by the plague. Many ships were seized if they were found to have traces of the plague and taken into quarantine. The search and seizure of many ships that had goods that were impacted the plague also resulted in different maritime procedures and a delay in times for the passages of ships – resulting in delayed voyages and arrival of traded goods.
In addition to the bubonic plague, another form of plague quickly spread across Egypt as well. The cattle plague came across Egypt from Sudan and infected the cattle of Egypt and the produce market as well. The outbreak first came across Sudan and then impacted Egypt through imports from Sudan. The epidemic only affects cattle and cows directly and causes the death of these animals in large quantities. However, the cattle plague does affect humans indirectly also. The lack of cows leads to a lack of products that result from cattle causing a shift in the Egypt economy, market, and dietary habits of the people of Egypt. The cattle plague also affects the residents of Egypt since the consumption of milk and other products that originate from cattle may result in illnesses to the individual who has digested it. Although the cattle plague was still a significant epidemic in Egypt, it did not affect as many humans as the bubonic plague did. In two articles of the “Egyptian Gazette” that discussed the cattle plague, readers can analyze how long the cattle plague was a significant epidemic in Egypt and surrounding regions. Articles from January of 1905 indicate that the cattle plague began in late 1903 and continued severely through the middle of 1905. Although, the cattle plague lasted until 1906 with scarce and spaced out incidences of cattle plague diagnoses. In 1904, 5,065 deaths in January were recorded as a result of the cattle plague. In 1905, the total cases reported in January of the cattle plague were 146,791. However, in 1905 measures to end the cattle plague began which resulted in less cases being reported and less fatalities as a result of the cattle plague. One measure taken in order to end the plague was having the cattle being treated with vaccinations to immune them from the illness. In the same time period in 1905, 884 animals were treated with the vaccine. The treatment of animals to prevent the cattle plague overall worked in certain regions in Egypt. In 1906, the cases per week shifted from hundreds of reported diagnoses into an average of 3 per week in May. However, as certain regions became clear of the epidemic, other regions began to break out in the epidemic if the government did not choose to prevent the plague before it arrived.
Because of the untraceable habits of fleas and the spread of the plague the prevention and end of the plague was difficult to solve and took several years and many deaths to finally prevent the different forms of the plague. Although Egypt suffered tremendously because of the plague, the epidemic also caused a change in societal views and priorities as a nation. The nation of Egypt grew economically and socially after ending the devastating disease that resulted in thousands of deaths of Egyptians and Europeans. Every district of the nation, from small villages to larger cities, came together in an effort to report cases and ending the bubonic and cattle plague as a whole from Egypt. The “Egyptian Gazette” played a large role in analyzing the events that the plague took part in and recording each instance and death that resulted from a form of the plague. The journalism efforts to cover the plague played a large role to locate where the plague was most prominent in to inform its readers and researchers who attempted to eliminate the illness from the districts of Egypt. Since the ending of the plague, the black death has not come back to Egypt which allowed for the prosper of the nation as a port city for trade and opportunities within the markets.
The analysis of the plague in Egypt through the articles of the "Egyptian Gazette" was useful since it offered a direct source of the plague and its effects of the people of Egypt. However, varying and practical sources of information from a different lens would have also been useful. Since the "Egyptian Gazette" typically holds the lens of a journalist to inform readers, other point of views that could have been vital to an analysis of the plague of Egypt could have been those found in a medical examination or research paper.
