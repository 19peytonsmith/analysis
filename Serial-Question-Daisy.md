My serial question is, "How did the Cattle Plague affect populations during the year of 1905?" I am asking this question because epidemics of serious health conditions were becoming a problem with trade patterns and morality rates in Africa and Asia. We know medicine back in the early 20th century was not advanced enough to work on containing or reducing epidemic situation, establishing herd immunity as we do today. The information in the Egyptian Gazette can provide mortality rates amongst populations, locations of where the epidemic of cattle plague has spread, detailed stories of cattle plague relating to the trading crisis, and delays in societal progression.


I am querying the text for terms such as: "cattle", "plague", "mortality", "trade" and "bubonic plague, to compare the information of those affected by both plagues during the year of 1905. After searching with each key word, I found that Cattle Plague mostly affected the Egyptian Market Companies, being closed for over two year due to outbreaks of cattle plague. Then, using Google Maps, I am in the process of plotting points at the various locations of where cases of Cattle Plague have been spotted, then tagging them with a description of the available information. The points are numbered by the approximate amount of deaths due to the cattle plague, according to the information in the digital newspaper.


In my serial question visualization, the mortality rates within Egypt are presented since the epidemic of cattle plague began. Reaching Egypt in the late 19th century, the mortality rates are divided by the major cities (Governorates), Upper Egypt, and Lower Egypt. Within the Digital Egyptian Gazette, data was limited to the change of mortality within two months, therefore, that is all I could have represented in my visual. Overall, the mortality rates in areas of Egypt only change slightly because their was only an acute outbreak of cattle plague in 1905. However, the numbers do change by the hundreds within two months which is terrifying thought for us nowadays. 


As the project has been coming together I have noticed that the cattle plague in the year of 1905 was on an acute outbreak. However, the epidemic affected several in the 1890's, causing Egypt to recover from the consequences of cattle plague. There is an emphasis on increasing sales of cattle, but with some limitations. Individuals were still catching symptoms of severe fever due to cattle plague. According to outside sources, the epidemic continued for a while, but early 19th century was an even more difficult time to survive plague; immunity wasn't developed for cattle plague until 1913.



All in all, Egypt was one of the various areas affected the epidemic of Cattle Plague. As seen in the visualization, cattle plague began in parts of Asia, reaching Egypt, and once the plague came to Egypt, it spread to other parts of Africa. Plague became an obstacle for several as far as market sales, human health, animal health, and trade.
